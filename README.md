# Project Description

In this project, we use a neural network to clone car driving behaviour.  It is a supervised regression problem between the car steering angle, throttle, and the road images in front of the car.

Those images were taken from three different camera angles (from the centre, the left, and the right of the car).

The goal is to build a Neural Network Model using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) Fram Work that takes the three Images and outputs the steering angle and the throttle the car must take


# How to run
After Cloning this repo and you have done all the previous tasks Open the terminal and run 

`python drive.py model.pth images`
 
Then open the simulator in Autonomous mode. Now you can see the performance of your trained model :)
